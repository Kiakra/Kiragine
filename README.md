<h2 id="why">Why am i writing this?</h2>
<p>I want to create a 2D game, unfortunately other game engines so big or in weird languages that i don't want to use.</p>
<p>For example, Defold it's powerful enough to create the game that i planned. It's lightweight and fast and</p> 
<p>it has a very powerful design, messages! Tho i have to use lua and i <strong>really</strong> want to avoid lua.</p>
<p>There is one framework that i might use which is raylib. But it's in C. Why not use zig?</p>
<p>Yes i know, there is a binding for raylib. But it does not feel native, there is a lot more reasons but in the end i decided to write my own.</p>
<p>So the development of the engine will be slow, when i need a feature in the engine, i'll implement it. But development won't stop for a long time.</p>
<p>It's not a game engine for a specific game type! So if you need a feature feel free to open an issue, or find a bug!</p>
<p>Even better, feel free to open PR. I appreciate it :)</p> 
<h2 id="about-release-cycle">About release cycle</h2>
<ul>
<li>Versioning: major.minor.patch</li>
<li>Every x.x.3 creates a new minor, which becomes x.(x + 1).0</li>
<li>Again every x.3.x creates a new major, which becomes (x + 1).0.x</li>
<li>When a minor gets created, there will be a new release</li>
<li>When a new version comes, it'll comitted as x.x.x source update</li>
</ul>
